"18.3","18.3.1","(L1) Ensure LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE is installed","18.3.1 - (L1) Ensure LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension  CSE is installed","In May 2015, Microsoft released the Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) tool, which is free and supported software that allows an organization to automatically set randomized and unique local Administrator account passwords on domain-attached workstations and Member Servers. The passwords are stored in a confidential attribute of the domain computer account and can be retrieved from Active Directory by approved Sysadmins when needed.

The LAPS tool requires a small Active Directory Schema update in order to implement, as well as installation of a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) on targeted computers. Please see the LAPS documentation for details.

LAPS supports Windows Vista or newer workstation OSes, and Server 2003 or newer server OSes. LAPS does not support standalone computers - they must be joined to a domain.

**Note:** Organizations that utilize 3rd-party commercial software to manage unique & complex local Administrator passwords on domain members may opt to disregard these LAPS recommendations.

**Note #2:** LAPS is only designed to manage _local_ Administrator passwords, and is therefore not recommended (or supported) for use directly on Domain Controllers, which do not have a traditional local Administrator account. We strongly encourage you to only deploy the LAPS CSE and LAPS GPO settings to member servers and workstations.","In order to utilize LAPS, a minor Active Directory Schema update is required, and a Group Policy Client Side Extension (CSE) must be installed on each managed computer. When LAPS is installed, the file `AdmPwd.dll` must be present in the following location and registered in Windows (the LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE installation does this for you):

 ```
C:\Program Files\LAPS\CSE\AdmPwd.dll
```","The LAPS AdmPwd GPO Extension / CSE can be verified to be installed by the presence of the following registry value:

 ```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GPExtensions\{D76B9641-3288-4f75-942D-087DE603E3EA}:DllName

"1.2","1.2.3","(L1) Ensure 'Allow Administrator account lockout' is set to 'Enabled'","1.2.3 - (L1) Ensure Allow Administrator account lockout is set to Enabled","This policy setting determines whether the built-in Administrator account is subject to the following Account Lockout Policy settings: _Account lockout duration_, _Account lockout threshold_, and _Reset account lockout counter_. By default, this account is excluded from the account lockout controls and will never be locked out with repeated bad password attempts. 

The recommended state for this setting is: `Enabled`.

**Note:** This setting applies only to OSes patched as of October 11, 2022 (see [MS KB5020282](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5020282-account-lockout-available-for-built-in-local-administrators-bce45c4d-f28d-43ad-b6fe-70156cb2dc00)).","To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to `Enabled`:
