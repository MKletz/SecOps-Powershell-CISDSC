# How do I get the CIS documentation?
The benchmarks are available via the [CIS workbench](https://workbench.cisecurity.org/) and require a free account to access.

There is a lot of items available via the workbench site so it's easiest to find what you're looking for with tags.

It is important to get the most recent version of these items. All versions are made available on this site. You will need the excel copy of the benchmarks and the build kit (GPOs for Windows) for most cases.
